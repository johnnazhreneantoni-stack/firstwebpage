<h2>Top 10 life changing shows</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>1st The Wolf of Wall Street </h3>
<p>The Wolf of Wall Street is a 2013 American epic biographical dark comedy crime film[3] co-produced and directed by
Martin Scorsese, written by Terence Winter, and based on Jordan Belfort&#39;s 2007 memoir. It loosely recounts Belfort&#39;s
career as a stockbroker in New York City and how his firm, Stratton Oakmont, engaged in rampant corruption and fraud on
Wall Street, leading to his downfall. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Belfort; Jonah Hill as his business partner
and friend Donnie Azoff; Margot Robbie as his second wife, Naomi Lapaglia; Matthew McConaughey as his mentor and former
boss Mark Hanna; and Kyle Chandler as FBI special agent Patrick Denham portraying Gregory Coleman. It is DiCaprio&#39;s
fifth collaboration with Scorsese.</p>
<h3>2nd Spawn</h3>
<p>&quot;Spawn” is best seen as an experimental art film. It walks and talks like a big budget horror film, heavy on special
effects and pitched at the teenage audience, and maybe that’s how it will be received. But it’s more impressive if you
ignore the genre and just look at what’s on the screen. What we have here are creators in several different areas doing
their best to push the envelope. The subject is simply an excuse for their art–just as it always is with serious
artists.</p>
<h3>3rd Berserk</h3>
<p>Berserk (Japanese: ベルセルク, Hepburn: Beruseruku) is a Japanese manga series created by Kentaro Miura. Set in a medieval
Europe–inspired dark fantasy world, the story centers on the characters of Guts, a swordsman, and Griffith, the leader
of a mercenary group called the Band of the Hawk. The series follows Guts&#39; journey seeking revenge on Griffith, who
betrayed him and the rest of their comrades.

Miura premiered a prototype of Berserk in 1988. The series began publication the following year in Hakusensha&#39;s seinen
manga magazine Monthly Animal House [ja], which was changed to the semimonthly magazine Young Animal in 1992, where
Berserk has since continued its publication. Following Miura&#39;s death in May 2021, the final chapter that he worked on
was published posthumously in September of the same year; the series resumed in June 2022, under the supervision of
Miura&#39;s fellow manga artist and childhood friend Kouji Mori and Miura&#39;s group of assistants and apprentices from Studio
Gaga. As of August 2025, the Berserk chapters have been collected in 43 tankōbon volumes.

Berserk was adapted into a 25-episode anime television series by OLM, which covered the Golden Age story arc, and was
broadcast from October 1997 to March 1998. The Golden Age arc was also adapted into a trilogy of theatrical anime films;
the first two films premiered in 2012 and the third film premiered in 2013. A second 24-episode anime television series
adaptation was broadcast for two seasons in 2016 and 2017.

Berserk has been widely acclaimed, particularly for its dark setting, storytelling, characters, and Miura&#39;s detailed
artwork. By August 2025, the manga had over 70 million copies in circulation worldwide, making it one of the
best-selling manga series of all time. It received the Award for Excellence at the sixth annual Tezuka Osamu Cultural
Prize in 2002.</p>
<h3>4th Straight Outta Compton</h3>
<p>Straight Outta Compton is a 2015 American epic biographical drama film that tells the story of hip-hop group N.W.A&#39;s
rise and fall under manager Jerry Heller. The film, directed by F. Gary Gray, stars O’Shea Jackson Jr., Corey Hawkins,
and Jason Mitchell as Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, and Eazy-E, respectively. Released in August 2015, the film received critical
acclaim and was a box office success, grossing $201.6 million worldwide. Straight Outta Compton earned several awards
and nominations, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay and a win for Outstanding Motion
Picture at the 47th NAACP Image Awards.</p>

<h3>5th Rocky(1976)</h3>
<p>Rocky is a 1976 American independent[3] sports drama film directed by John G. Avildsen, written by and starring
Sylvester Stallone. It is the first installment in the Rocky franchise and also stars Talia Shire, Burt Young, Carl
Weathers, and Burgess Meredith. In the film, Rocky Balboa (Stallone), a poor small-time club fighter and loanshark debt
collector from Philadelphia, gets an unlikely once in a lifetime shot at the world heavyweight championship held by
Apollo Creed (Weathers).

Rocky entered development in March 1975, after Stallone wrote the screenplay in three days. It entered a complicated
production process after Stallone refused to allow the film to be made without him in the lead role; United Artists
eventually agreed to cast Stallone after he rejected a six figure deal for the film rights. Principal photography began
in January 1976, with filming primarily held in Philadelphia; several locations featured in the film, such as the Rocky
Steps, are now considered cultural landmarks.[4] With an estimated production budget of under $1.1 million, Rocky
popularized the rags to riches and American Dream themes of sports dramas which preceded the film.</p>
<h3>6th The Shawshank Redemtiom</h3>
<p>The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont, based on the 1982 Stephen
King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. The film tells the story of banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who
is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the murders of his wife and her lover, despite his claims of
innocence. Over the following two decades, he befriends a fellow prisoner, contraband smuggler Ellis &quot;Red&quot; Redding
(Morgan Freeman), and becomes instrumental in a money laundering operation led by the prison warden Samuel Norton (Bob
Gunton). William Sadler, Clancy Brown, Gil Bellows, and James Whitmore appear in supporting roles.

Darabont purchased the film rights to King&#39;s story in 1987, but development did not begin until five years later, when
he wrote the script over eight weeks. Two weeks after submitting his script to Castle Rock Entertainment, Darabont
secured a $25 million budget to produce The Shawshank Redemption, which started pre-production in January 1993. While
the film is set in Maine, principal photography took place from June to August 1993 almost entirely in Mansfield, Ohio,
with the Ohio State Reformatory serving as the eponymous penitentiary. The project attracted many stars for the role of
Andy, including Tom Hanks, Tom Cruise, and Kevin Costner. Thomas Newman provided the film&#39;s score.</p>
<h3>7th The Truman Show</h3>
<p>The Truman Show is a 1998 American comedy-drama film[2] written and co-produced by Andrew Niccol, and directed by Peter
Weir. The film depicts the story of Truman Burbank (played by Jim Carrey), a man who is unaware that he is living his
entire life on a colossal soundstage, and that it is being filmed and broadcast as a reality television show that has a
huge international following. All of his friends, family, and members of his community are paid actors whose job is to
sustain the illusion and keep Truman unaware that the world he inhabits is scripted and fake. The film&#39;s supporting cast
includes Laura Linney, Ed Harris, Noah Emmerich, Natascha McElhone, Holland Taylor and Paul Giamatti.

Niccol&#39;s original spec script was more of a science-fiction thriller, with the story set in New York City. Producer
Scott Rudin purchased the script and set up production at Paramount Pictures. Brian De Palma was to direct before Weir
signed on as director, making the film for $60 million—$20 million less than the original estimate. Niccol rewrote the
script while the crew was waiting for Carrey to sign. The majority of filming took place at Seaside, Florida, a
master-planned community located in the Florida Panhandle.</p>
<h3>8th Dead Poets Society</h3>
<p>Dead Poets Society is a 1989 American coming-of-age drama film directed by Peter Weir and written by Tom Schulman. The
film, starring Robin Williams, is set in 1959 at a fictional elite boarding school called Welton Academy.[4] It tells
the story of an English teacher who inspires his students through his teaching of poetry.

Dead Poets Society was produced by Touchstone Pictures and Silver Screen Partners IV and released in the United States
by Buena Vista Pictures Distribution on June 2, 1989.[4] The film was a commercial success and received critical
acclaim. It grossed $235.9 million worldwide against a $16.4 million budget, becoming the fifth-highest-grossing film of
1989. The film received numerous accolades, including Academy Award nominations for Best Picture and Best Director and a
Best Actor nomination for Williams. The film won the BAFTA Award for Best Film,[5] the C&#233;sar Award for Best Foreign Film
and the David di Donatello Award for Best Foreign Film. Schulman received the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay
for his work. </p>

<h3>9th Fight Club</h3>
<p> Fight Club is a 1999 American film directed by David Fincher and starring Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, and Helena Bonham
Carter. It is based on the 1996 novel by Chuck Palahniuk. Norton plays the unnamed narrator, who is discontented with
his white-collar job. He forms a &quot;fight club&quot; with a soap salesman, Tyler Durden (Pitt), and becomes embroiled with an
impoverished but beguiling woman, Marla Singer (Bonham Carter).

Palahniuk&#39;s novel was optioned by Fox 2000 Pictures producer Laura Ziskin, who hired Jim Uhls to write the film
adaptation. Fincher was selected because of his enthusiasm for the story. He developed the script with Uhls and sought
screenwriting advice from the cast and others in the film industry. It was filmed in and around Los Angeles from July to
December 1998. He and the cast compared the film to Rebel Without a Cause (1955) and The Graduate (1967), with a theme
of conflict between Generation X and the value system of advertising.[5][6]

Studio executives did not like the film and restructured Fincher&#39;s intended marketing campaign to try to reduce
anticipated losses. Fight Club premiered at the 56th Venice International Film Festival on September 10, 1999, and was
released in the United States on October 15, 1999, by 20th Century Fox. The film failed to meet the studio&#39;s
expectations at the box office and polarized critics. It was ranked as one of the most controversial and talked-about
films of the 1990s. However, Fight Club later found commercial success with its home video release, establishing it as a
cult classic and causing media to revisit the film. In 2009, on its tenth anniversary, The New York Times dubbed it the
&quot;defining cult movie of our time&quot;.[7]</p>
<h3>10th Into The Wild</h3>
<p>Into the Wild is a 2007 American biographical adventure drama film written, co-produced, and directed by Sean Penn. It
is an adaptation of the 1996 non-fiction book of the same name written by Jon Krakauer and tells the story of
Christopher McCandless (&quot;Alexander Supertramp&quot;), a man who hiked across North America into the Alaskan wilderness in the
early 1990s. The film stars Emile Hirsch as McCandless, Hal Holbrook, and Catherine Keener.

The film premiered during the 2007 Rome Film Fest and opened outside Fairbanks, Alaska, on September 21, 2007.</p>
